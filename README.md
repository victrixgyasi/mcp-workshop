# MCP Workshop

Learn to build MCP servers by extending Claude's capabilities.

## Exercises
1. **[Exercise 1: Send Email](https://github.com/izaakrogan/fac-mcp/tree/exercise-1)** - Build your first MCP server with a `send_email` tool
2. **[Exercise 2: Email Assistant](https://github.com/izaakrogan/fac-mcp/tree/exercise-2)** - Fetch emails and generate draft replies using MCP sampling

## Bonus
- **[Exercise 3: Tool Use From Scratch](https://github.com/izaakrogan/fac-mcp/tree/exercise-3)** - See how LLMs actually output JSON for tool calls (fine-tuning + constrained decoding)

## Getting Started
```bash
git clone https://github.com/izaakrogan/fac-mcp.git
cd fac-mcp
git checkout exercise-1
